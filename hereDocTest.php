The first Alice was a wrathful woman of the spade.
And righteously she held a sharpened blade within her hand.
Never hesitating to slay all within her way.
Creating paths of blood that followed her through Wonderland.
Deep in the darkened forest, Alice walked the line.
Captured and imprisoned as an embodiment of Sin.
If it were not for the murderous wake left behind
No one would have suspected that she had ever been.
