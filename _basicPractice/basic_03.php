		The potato is a starchy, tuberous crop from the perennial nightshade 
		Solanum tuberosum L. The word "potato" may refer either to the plant 
		itself or the edible tuber. In the Andes, where the species is 
		indigenous, there are some other closely related cultivated potato 
		species. Potatoes were introduced outside the Andes region approximately 
		four centuries ago, and have since become an integral part of much of the 
		world's food supply. It is the world's fourth-largest food crop, following 
		maize, wheat, and rice.
